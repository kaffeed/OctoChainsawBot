# OctoChainsaw

OctoChainsaw is a helper bot built on botkit (https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) for slack, built in typescript.

In order to start OctoChainsaw, simply clone it and install it's dependencies via 
'npm install'

Afterwards, start the bot by running 

'slackClientId=<yourSlackClientId> slackClientSecret=<yourSlackClientSecret> port=<port> mittagApiToken=<mittagApiToken> node build/index.js'

As of now, OctoChainsaws capabilities approach nearly zero. 
It only has an api wrapper for http://mittag.at and can display daily menus of my favorite restaurants around my work. 
This might change in the near future - hopefully it does.
